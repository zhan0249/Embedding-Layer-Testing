# Embedding-Layer-Testing
This notebook is created to test Keras embedding layer performance between learnt embedding and pre-trained GloVe (100 dimension) embedding.
# Conclusions
Althought pre-trained GloVe embedding performed must faster (just performing looking-up), the learnt embedding had a better performance using only 10 epochs.
